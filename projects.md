[Sending Pathways](https://ubahouston.org/pathways) is a UBA initiative working with local churches to develop intentional systems that lead to multiplicative sending into an array of Great Commission tasks. Churches must work from within their own congregation to identify, equip, send, and support members in activities such as plantind and replanting churches, engaging in disapora missions in their own communities, and sending missionaries internationally.

## Church Renewal

Revitalization has been a topic for a while, but as the generational turnover and rapid cultural shifts in our nation are occurring, there is a resulting wave of declining churches. The process of replanting steps into that gap. Replanting is often a more radical process than traditional revitalization. It’s the process of relaunching a church with a different identity and structure after a period of intense assessment and reconfiguration.
