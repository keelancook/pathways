This site is the equipping hub for the Sending Pathways initiative. It is a tool to help local churches identify, equip, send, and support their own sent ones for an array of Great Commission tasks. Pathways is a collection of resources and an equipping portal for local churches to develop their own sent ones for an array of Great Commission tasks.

## Resource Hub
On this site, you will find a collection of materials for local churches looking to implement sending processes within their church. These materials include reading lists, potential equipping cohort materials, and explainers for developing a sending culture within a church. This resource hub is continually in development, and we hope to continue adding valuable tools as we develop them.

## Equipping Portal
In addition to a resource hub, we desire that the site itself will become a tool for training both churches and potential sent ones from their churches. Our goal is to provide a central location for associations, churches, and individuals to point those they are equipping to walk through a training process.

## The Union Baptist Association
Sending Pathways is an initiative of the Union Baptist Association, and was designed specifically for our churches. However, our desire has always been for our work with this issue to be a resource to other associations and church networks. To that end, we've developed this site with minimal branding as a resource to the church in North America.
